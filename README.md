# HomeKit for Homey

With this app you can pair Homey to HomeKit and control your devices using Siri.

After installing the app grab your iPhone or iPad.
Got to the Home app on your iOS devices, click the `+` and add new accessory.
Now you should be able to scan the code below, or add it manually.

After Homey is paired, go to settings->HomeKit. There select the devices you want to pair with HomeKit.

It might take a few sec (sometimes even longer) until your device shows up in your Home app.

For now only the following classes are supported:
- Light (On-off, dim, Temperature control, RGB)
- Fan
- Switch
- Outlet
- Doorlock
- Motion sensor
- Humidity sensor
- Light sensor
- Carbon dioxide sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Leak sensor
- Smoke sensor
- Contact sensor
- AirQuality sensor

- Volume speaker
- Vacuum cleaner
- Button (simple and Play/Pause etc)

+ Battery service for all
